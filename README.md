# Using Test Containers to Test MySQL Interactions with JUnit 5

This demo is used to show how you can use [Test Containers](https://testcontainers.com/) to test code that interacts with a MySQL Database.

The examples are meant to show the process that needs to be followed and are not intended as a comprehensive example of how to test code.

These examples use [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/).

## Getting started

Before you can dive into these examples, you need to have Docker Desktop (or an alternative) installed. See the [documentation for use with Java](https://java.testcontainers.org/).

Once you have cloned the repo, open the project in an IDE and load the Gradle project.
